        <p>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer?<quote>My advice would be to experiment with as different cameras and go to your local camera store to test them out. Even just holding certain cameras will help you decide what you like and what you don't like.</quote></p>

        <p>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer? <quote>When I first started my photography journey, I started following photographers I liked online and tried to step outside of my comfort zone by asking them about the cameras they used. I was surprised at how helpful they were and how generous they were with their time, teaching me the basics of photography—which is why I want to return the favour to young creatives</quote></p>
