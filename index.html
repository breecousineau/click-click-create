          <h3>Anil Mukherjee</h3>
          <p>My name is Anil and I am a professional photographer based in Bangladesh. My favourite subject to photograph is architecture, as I really love the beauty and simplicity of structures. I use the Nikon Z6 to shoot and love the quality of the photos and how easy it is to shoot with. <strong>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer?</strong> <quote> My advice would be to experiment with as different cameras and go to your local camera store to test them out. Even just holding certain cameras will help you decide what you like and what you don't like.</quote></p>

          <p><strong>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer?</strong> <quote>When I first started my photography journey, I started following photographers I liked online and tried to step outside of my comfort zone by asking them about the cameras they used. I was surprised at how helpful they were and how generous they were with their time, teaching me the basics of photography—which is why I want to return the favour to young creatives!</quote></p>

          <h3>Ella Pierson</h3>
          <p>Hi! I'm Ella! I'm a Vancouver-based photographer that specializes in portrait and street photography. I love experimenting with different shutter speeds with moving objects as well as different effects! That's why I chose the Fujifilm x100v as it allows for endless effects and even mimics film! I also love using Adobe Lightroom because there are tons of options to edit photos. <strong>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer?</strong> <quote>Figure out what kind of photography you're interested in and do research on the specs of cameras. I tried to mimic photos with just my phone by using different filters and using plastic wrap to get cool glare effects. Once you figure out your style, you'll be able to better narrow down the equipment.</p>

            <h3>Jay Stanley</h3>
            <p>Hey! I'm Jay Stanley, I'm an LA-based film photographer that doesn't go anywhere without a roll of film! I love the old-school vibes of film and got into it by learning from my dad who is also a photographer. I've met some really cool people in LA and am constantly taking photos of those around me which I find really special. <strong>What advice would you give to an aspiring photographer?</strong> <quote>I would say take pictures of everything. Even if you are just using your phone, you are exercising your creative eye—which will really help you when you are first starting out. And if you really know you want to get into film, I reccomend buying a second hand film camera and experimenting with different rolls of film. It's a lot less intimidating than you might think!</quote></p>
